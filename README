evercookie 0.3 -- never forget.

The only files that need to be in your web directory are:
 evercookie.js
 evercookie_png.php
 evercookie_etag.php
 evercookie.swf

If evercookie_etag.php and evercookie_png.php are missing or
your server doesn't have PHP support, evercookie will still
function but without support for auto-generated PNG caching
or ETag caching.

If evercookie.swf is missing, evercookie will still function,
but without support for Local Shared Objects (Flash Cookies).
